# Sentiment Classification of Iranian tweets During COVID-19 with Pars Bert

This project focuses on sentiment classification of Iranian tweets during the COVID-19 pandemic using ParsBERT, a pre-trained BERT model for Persian language processing. By analyzing tweets, we aim to understand public sentiment and reactions to the pandemic in Iran, providing insights into how the situation affected people's emotions and attitudes.

## Project Overview

We collected a dataset of Iranian tweets related to COVID-19 and preprocessed it to remove noise such as hashtags, @mentions, IDs, and stopwords. ParsBERT, a specialized model for the Persian language, is utilized to perform the sentiment analysis task, categorizing tweets into different sentiment classes such as positive, negative, and neutral.
